## modes.py
 `` modes.py `` is an lightweight interface system for the Raspberry Pi based on shorting connectors on the GPIO header. It turns a Raspberry Pi into an electronic swiss army knife that doesn't require input or output devices.

 `` modes.py `` comes with built-in support for the Raspberry Pi camera and WZBC 90.3 FM, among other things. It can also call a user-created shell script at `` /home/pi/bin/wifi.sh `` , and other user-defined scripts and programs can easily be added.
