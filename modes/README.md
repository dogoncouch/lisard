# LISARD modes system
## Goals
The goal of the modes system is to provide a minimal interface system to a Raspberry Pi. One way communication is achieved by connecting 3.3v outputs to various GPIO input pins.

## Hardware
The LISARD modes system was developed for Raspberry Pi hardware. It should work with any Raspberry Pi, provided the necessary libraries are installed.

## Required modules
The lisard module is required, and is also in the repo. Camera support requires the picamera module, and remote recording support requires the paramiko module (python-paramiko).

## Usability
This project is pre-alpha. Documentation is incomplete.
