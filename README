Log Intelligent Security Aware Resilient Daemon

==== Underlying Theories ====

* AI should start with the goals of lizard-like intelligence:
    Be aware of space
    Stay alive
    Leave the chessmaster/jeopardy stuff for later;
    It will evolve on top of our platform, like in real evolution

* Stereo audio and vision are necessary for spacial awareness
    Important attributes are direction and range
    Redundant senses help with awareness of sensory issues and conditions

* Survivability is key
    Organs should be able to operate without any part except CNS


==== Systems (Organs) ====

* Central Nervous System (CNS)
    Receives input from senses, correlates; makes low-level decisions
    Tries to establish range and direction of motion/sounds
    Communicates with parts via ad-hoc/LAN network (also on internet)
    Runs update proxy for parts to stay up to date
    Used for debugging initially, then debugging moves to comm cluster

Sensory "eye" cluster:
* Motion sensor
    Senses motion, creates syslog events, forwards to CNS
* Camera
    Provides purely reference data for use analyzing log events

Sensory "eye" cluster #2:
* Motion sensor
    Helps tune out false positives
* Camera
    Cameras record each other for security

Sensory "sound" cluster:
* Microphone
    Reference data for spacial awareness

Sensory "sound" cluster #2:
* Microphone
    Used for triangulation and spacial awareness


==== Later Versions ====

Communication cluster:
* Speech recognition system
    JASPER on raspberry pi
    Used for authentication requests, etc.
* Visual/keyboard/mouse communication system
    Used for authentication, debugging, etc.

Analytics cluster:
* Analytics Processor
    Higher brain function; makes high-level decisions
    Establishes the nature of entities
        Tries to identify person(/non-person) on motion sense
        Tries to identify types of sound sources
